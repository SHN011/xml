1. Syntax and Structure:

HTML: More forgiving, allows some flexibility in syntax (e.g., optional closing tags for some elements, case-insensitive tags and attributes).
XHTML: Stricter, follows XML rules:
All elements must be closed (even empty elements with /).
All tags and attributes must be lowercase.
Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes.
Elements must be properly nested.
2. Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE):

HTML: Optional, but recommended for validation and compatibility.
XHTML: Required to specify the XHTML version and DTD.
3. Namespace:

HTML: No namespace.
XHTML: Uses the XHTML namespace (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml").
4. Error Handling:

HTML: Browsers try to display pages even with errors, potentially leading to unpredictable results.
XHTML: Browsers may not display pages with syntax errors, enforcing better coding practices.
5. Compatibility:

HTML: Supported by all browsers.
XHTML: Supported by most modern browsers, but older browsers might have compatibility issues.
6. Future Development:

HTML: Continues to evolve with new versions (HTML5, HTML6).
XHTML: Development has largely stopped in favor of HTML5.
